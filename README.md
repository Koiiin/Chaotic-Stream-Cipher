# Chaotic Stream Cipher using Gauss Map

## Overview

This project implements a simple XOR-based stream cipher using a chaotic keystream generated by the Gauss Map. The cipher can be used to encrypt and decrypt binary files (e.g., images, documents, executables) by generating a pseudo-random keystream and applying an XOR operation.

> **Disclaimer:** This encryption method is for educational and experimental purposes only. It is not secure for real-world cryptographic applications.

## How It Works

The encryption and decryption process follows these steps:

1. A chaotic keystream is generated using the Gauss Map function:

   ```math
   x_{n+1} = e^{-\alpha x_n^2} + \beta
   ```

   - **x₀** is the initial seed (must be between -1 and 1).
   - **α** controls the nonlinearity of the system (recommended range: 1 ≤ α ≤ 10).
   - **β** is an offset parameter (recommended range: -0.5 ≤ β ≤ 0.5).

2. The keystream values are mapped to bytes (0-255) to match the length of the input file.

3. Each byte of the input file is XORed with the corresponding keystream byte.

4. The resulting file is saved as the encrypted or decrypted output.

Since XOR is a symmetric operation, encryption and decryption use the same function.

## Usage

Run the script from the command line:

```sh
python chaotic_cipher.py
```

Follow the interactive prompts:

1. Choose **encrypt** or **decrypt** mode.
2. Enter the input file path.
3. Enter the output file path.
4. Provide values for **x₀**, **α**, and **β**.

### Example

**Encrypt a file:**

```sh
python chaotic_cipher.py
```

```
Enter mode (encrypt/decrypt): encrypt
Enter path to input file: example.txt
Enter path to output file: encrypted.bin
Enter Gauss map seed x₀ (-1 < x₀ < 1): 0.35
Enter Gauss map parameter α (1 ≤ α ≤ 10): 4.9
Enter Gauss map parameter β (-0.5 ≤ β ≤ 0.5): 0.2
```

```
Done. Encrypted file saved to 'encrypted.bin'.
```

**Decrypt the file:**

```sh
python chaotic_cipher.py
```

*Provide the same parameters used for encryption to correctly recover the original file.*

## Notes

- The same `(x₀, α, β)` values must be used for both encryption and decryption.
- Small changes in parameters lead to drastic changes in keystream due to the chaotic nature of the Gauss Map.
- The encryption is not secure against cryptographic attacks and is purely for experimental purposes.
